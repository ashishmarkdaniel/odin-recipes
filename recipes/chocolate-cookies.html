    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Â¾ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <b><li>Step 1</li></b>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</p>
        <b><li>Step 2</li></b>
        <p>Beat butter and sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg and vanilla, beating until incorporated.</p>
        <b><li>Step 3</li></b>
        <p>Whisk together flour, cocoa, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until combined. With mixer on low speed, gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture, 
            beating until well combined, about 2 minutes.</p>
        <b><li>Step 4</li></b>
        <p>Roll dough into 1 1/4-inch balls, then roll balls in sanding sugar. Place on the prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. 
            Press the center of each ball with your thumb (about 1/2-inch deep and 1/2-inch wide).</p>
