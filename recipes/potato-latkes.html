    <h1>Mom's Potato Latkes</h1>
    <img src="../images/potato-latkes.webp">
    <p>Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful any time of the year! 
        This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best potato latke I've had. I usually end up making a second batch because they disappear so quickly. 
        I've tried other recipes and always return to this one. Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup grated onion</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <b><li>Step 1</li></b>
        <p>Mix potato, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</p>
        <b><li>Step 2</li></b>
        <p>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</p>
        <b><li>Step 3</li></b>
        <p>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so they are an even thickness.</p>
        <b><li>Step 4</li></b>
        <p>Cook in batches in the hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a paper towel-line plate.</p>
    </ol>
